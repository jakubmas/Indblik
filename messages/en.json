      {
        "question": "What is hypnotherapy?",
        "answer": "Hypnotherapy is a therapeutic approach where we work with the subconscious mind to create deep and lasting change. It takes place in a relaxed, focused state - similar to when you daydream. You remain conscious and in control throughout."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is hypnosis dangerous?",
        "answer": "No, hypnosis is a natural and completely safe state that we all experience daily - for example, just before falling asleep or when absorbed in a good book. In therapy, you're in a safe environment and gently guided throughout."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I lose control during hypnosis?",
        "answer": "No, not at all. You remain yourself and can open your eyes or speak up at any time. Hypnotherapy isn't about 'taking over' you - but about helping you connect more deeply with yourself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does hypnotherapy work for everyone?",
        "answer": "Most people can benefit greatly from hypnotherapy - especially if they're open and curious. You don't need to 'believe in hypnosis' to see results, but collaboration and a desire for change are important."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does it feel to be in hypnosis?",
        "answer": "Most people describe it as deep relaxation, peace, and inward focus. Some feel light, others heavy - it's very individual. The important thing is that you always feel safe and part of the process."
